 Write a function that, given:

an amount of money
a list of coin denominations
computes the number of ways to make amount of money with coins of the available denominations.

Example: for amount=4 (4¢) and denominations=[1,2,3] (1¢, 2¢ and 3¢), your program would output 4—the number of ways to make 4¢ with those denominations:

1¢, 1¢, 1¢, 1¢
1¢, 1¢, 2¢
1¢, 3¢
2¢, 2¢
