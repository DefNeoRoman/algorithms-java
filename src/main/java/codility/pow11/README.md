Write a function:

class Solution { public int solution(int N); }

that, given a non-negative integer N, returns the number of digits equal to 1 in the decimal representation of the number 11N.

For example, given N=3 the function should return 2, because 113=1331 and two digits of the number 1331 are equal to 1.

Assume that:

N is an integer within the range [0..1,000].
Complexity:

expected worst-case time complexity is O(N2);
expected worst-case space complexity is O(N).
